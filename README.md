# Conference Presentations Archive

Welcome to my archive of technical presentations delivered at programming conferences since 2000. This collection showcases my professional journey and contributions to the tech community.

## Overview

As a speaker at both Italian and international technology events, I have covered a wide range of topics including:
- Java technologies
- Web development innovations
- Digital terrestrial (broadcast) programming
- Performance optimization
- Programming language evolution

## Repository structure

Each presentation entry includes:
- conference name
